# Supervised_Machine_Learning

### Background

Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as the number of good loans easily outnumber the number of risky loans. Therefore, you’ll need to employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. Use imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling. The final task is to evaluate the performance of these models and make a recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.

### Objectives

The goals of the challenge are:

    Implement machine learning models.
    Use resampling to attempt to address class imbalance.
    Evaluate the performance of machine learning models.


#### We completed this by using Jupyter Notebook file(s) with the code and analysis of the following models: 

    1. Oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms.
    2. Undersample the data using the cluster centroids algorithm.
    3. Use a combination approach with the SMOTEENN algorithm.
    4. Balanced Random Forest Classifier, combines resampling ad model training in a single step.
    5. Easy Ensemble Classifier, combines resampling ad model training in a single step.
    
Lastly, write a brief summary and analysis of the models’ performance. Describe the precision and recall scores, as well as the balanced accuracy score. Additionally, include a final recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
